# UFOs


## Overview of Project
Dana is a data journalist that has been given the opportunity to write about the UFO sightings in her hometown of McMinnville, Oregon.  She has a Javascript file full of sightings from all over North America and wants to use this data to support her online article.  To do this, she would like the data displayed in a table where users could easily use filters to narrow down the data to their selected areas of interest.


## Results
### UFO Data Table
* When users open up the webpage, the full list of UFO data is displayed.  There are events listed for various dates, cities, states, countries, and shapes of the sightings.

### Filters
* Since the data table has an overwhelming amount of sightings, there are filters to the left of the page that users can use to manipulate the data.

* Users can enter any search criteria they want and press enter to view the filtered data.  For example, if Dana wants to see the sightings for Oregon, she types "OR" into the "Enter a State" search field and presses ENTER.  The data is then filtered to only the UFO sightings that were in Oregon.

* If the user wants to further narrow down their search, they can enter more search criteria into the Filter Search fields.  For example, Dana could type "triangle" into the "Enter a Shape" search field and see that the data is now filtered to sightings that were located in Oregon and had triangle shapes.

* If the user wants to clear the data and view the entire data set again, they can simply delete the criteria from the search fields and press ENTER.  
  


## Summary

### Current Limitations
* One drawback to the current filter design is that the user does not know what options are within the data.  For example, if they wanted to see what countries are represented, they would need to either try every country abbreviation in the search fields or scroll through all of the data manually.  
### Possible Improvements
* One thing that would improve the filtering system is to have drop-down menus that contain the possible filtering options within each of the search fields.  
* Another improvement would be to add a button so the user could export the data to a csv or Excel file.
